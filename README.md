# ANITA: Autoregressive aNalysis and feature-based IdentificaTion for heat exchanger Assessment

ANITA is a data-driven framework for fouling diagnosis in heat exchangers using autoregressive (AR) modeling and feature-based Transfer Learning. This repository includes all datasets, models, and scripts necessary to reproduce the results presented in the master's thesis *Transferência de Aprendizado entre Modelos Orientados por Dados para o Monitoramento de Trocadores de Calor* (UNESP, 2025).

## Overview

The methodology is centered on building **Digital Shadows** of heat exchangers using AR models fitted to clean condition temperature curves. These models are then used to extract statistical features such as prediction error variance ratios and signal energy. A binary classifier (SVM) is trained to distinguish between clean and fouled conditions. To enhance generalization across different geometries and operational conditions, **feature-based Transfer Learning** is employed via the Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA) algorithm.

## Included Datasets

The repository provides three distinct datasets:

1. **Base 1 – ABC Simulation (Time-Dependent Degradation):**  
   Numerical simulations of two shell-and-tube heat exchangers with different geometries, using a reduced-order model and a stochastic degradation law for the global heat transfer coefficient (\( \mathbb{U} \)). Parameters are calibrated using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).

2. **Base 2 – Monte Carlo and AR Modeling (Statistical Degradation):**  
   Synthetic curves generated by Monte Carlo simulations from a Gamma-distributed \( \mathbb{U} \), without time dependence. AR models are used to represent thermal dynamics, and features are extracted for classification.

3. **Base 3 – Experimental Data:**  
   Real data collected from two physical heat exchangers: one shell-and-tube, and one plate-type. Clean condition curves were used to build AR models, and fouled conditions were emulated by perturbing system response parameters.

## Usage

The repository is organized into folders for each dataset, containing MATLAB scripts, figures, and configuration files. To reproduce the experiments, simply run the main scripts in the respective folders. All code has been tested with MATLAB R2023b or later.
